# Description

This is the main page for the KinShipCorrelationGenerator. It can be used to quickly, and efficiently calculate phenotypic correlations in different familial pairs, (e.g. twin-correlations, parent-offspring correlations, etc) in large complex pedigrees.
By default correlations are weighted for multiple occurrences of individuals to correct for larger families. 

See the documentation for more information.

# Usage
