# Patch notes

##### 24-11-2020 (v1.1.1)
 - Fixed an issue that would cause a new reformatted extended pedigree to be saved to the wrong directory.
 - Fixed an issue that would cause columns in `--exlucde` to still be included.

##### 23-11-2020 (v1.1.0)
 - Added `--bivar` option. See [Generating cross-trait-correlations](https://kinshipcorrelationgenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/computecorrelation.html#generating-cross-trait-correlations) in the documentation.
 - Rearranged arguments so the order they are printed in with `-h` and `--morehelp` are in line with documentation.

##### 19-11-2020 (v1.0.0)
 - Initial release

# Description

This is the main page for the KinShipCorrelationGenerator. It can be used to quickly, and efficiently calculate phenotypic correlations in different familial pairs, (e.g. twin-correlations, parent-offspring correlations, etc) in large complex pedigrees.
By default correlations are weighted for multiple occurrences of individuals to correct for larger families. 

See the [documentation](https://kinshipcorrelationgenerator.readthedocs.io/) for more information.

# Usage

See [documentation](https://kinshipcorrelationgenerator.readthedocs.io/).
